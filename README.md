## Overview of the Analysis
  
  After experiencing the CitiBikes in New York, we want to see if a similar service could be offered in Des Moines. In order to do so, we looked mainly at the use times across the week and duration of trips. 
  
## Results

## Summary

As can be seen by visualizations 1, 2, and 3 the durations for use are generally under 20 minutes, and usually either in the morning (for commuting to work) or in the early afternoon (for commuting home) for the work week (Monday to Friday). Additionally, almost 2/3 of the users are male even though the trip durations are approximately the same for both men and women and the use times are the same (visualizations 4, 5, 6). Males are also far more likely to be subscribers as opposed to customers (visualization 7). 

Suggestions for further analysis/visualization: show customer versus subscriber usage to see what causes males to be more likely to subscribe. Also, analyze the uses on the weekend. The weekend is also a popular time for use, and see if the duration is longer or if gender usage is more equal on the weekends.
